    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <div class="content-with-aside">
        <div>
            <p>
                The VDP is a multi-section page three levels deep into Cars.com displaying vehicle information
                and a lead form that lets users send car dealers and private sellers their contact information. At
                the time of this project, lead submission generated the greatest revenue for the&nbsp;business.
            </p>
            <p>
                When our Scrum team was formed, the VDP was very outdated, using legacy code with 5+
                years of front- and back-end tech debt. Our mission was to enhance the user experience with
                refreshed UI and interactive features in tandem with refactoring the code. Any changes had to
                be made carefully to not negatively affect lead submission. The site had 8 million monthly active
                users. Testing and gradual, incremental changes would be part of the strategy to update and
                evolve this&nbsp;app-within-a-site.
            </p>
            <p>
                We used consumer journey studies, lab user testing, A/B & multivariate testing, and best
                practices to evolve and optimize the VDP. Designers worked within and around an agile,
                sprint-based management system. At the same time, we were asked to iterate on possible, future
                states of the app that anticipate industry developments and trends.

    <h2>User Observation</h2>
    <p>
        Empathizing with our end users was a starting point for this initiative. We sent several UX team
        members into the homes of different user types (based on loosely-sketched Personas) to
        observe and interview them using the VDP in natural, field settings. After a few rounds of this,
        enough information was collected for patterns of pain points to emerge. These got absorbed into
        planning the redesign. We would continue to do user testing throughout the project, but moving
        forward, users were recruited to come in to our user lab to interact with prototypes.
    </p>

    <h2>User Stories and Story Mapping</h2>
    <p>
        Our team started out working in 2-week sprints, or iteration cycles. For each, we would prioritize
        the work to be done by writing user stories. Instead of specifications for new features described in
        technical terms, user stories describe features from the point of view of the customer and follow the
        “role-feature-reason”&nbsp;format:
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
        “As a User, I want to submit my personal information<br>so that I can
        establish contact with a car&nbsp;seller.”
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
        “As a User, I want to easily inspect car<br>photos so that I can make quality car&nbsp;selections.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Such stories helped tie user needs to feature development and created a shared understanding among
        team members on roadmap details.  As we learned more about what customers wanted, we could move
        things around in the product backlog, the queue of stories yet to be built.  We created digital and
        physical story maps to view the experience holistically and help prioritize for MVP and for subsequent
        releases. Story mapping helped us see the big picture of the product.

    <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
    <p>
        In order to know that the changes made were related to the results we were seeing and that we
        were drawing the right lessons from those changes, we would use split-tests. Split-test
        experiments are ones in which different versions of a product are offered to users at the same
        time. By observing the changes in behavior between two groups, we could make inferences
        about the impact of the different variations.

    </p>
    <p>
        To assure a scientific result, both product versions
        are identical in all respects but the one being tested. In Agile this is called “A/B Testing” after the
        practice of assigning letter names to each variation. To figure out if a new design was effective,
        we would look at key performance metrics like the number of lead submissions, number of
        clicks, time spent on the page, bounce rate, numbers of new visitors, and numbers of return
        visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
        A/B testing often uncovers surprising things. Many features that make the product better in the
        eyes of designers and engineers have no impact on user behavior. Although working with A/B
        tests requires extra accounting and metrics to keep track of each variation, it almost always
        saves time in the long run by eliminating work that doesn’t matter to users.
    </p>

    <h3>Some A/B test variables we looked at:</h3>
    <div class="multi-column section">
        <ul>
            <li>Language on buttons and tab labels</li>
            <li>Info field suppression in the contact form</li>
            <li>Lead form as modal vs. exposed on the page</li>
            <li>Lead form’s position on the page</li>
            <li>Adding icons to represent key vehicle data</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Varying size of photo rotator</li>
            <li>Varying number of thumbs in rotator</li>
            <li>Reducing the number of tabs</li>
            <li>Eliminating tabs</li>
            <li>Effects of modifying page layout</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            <h3 class="compact">Photo & Video Section</h3>
            <p>
                The layout of this had to create space for a new ad units. The 3-up, 4-up, and Mixed mockups
                here show scenarios with and without a vertical ad that was gradually&nbsp;abandoned.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to what was immediately feasible, we explored future page features like an
                interactive, multi-step lead form in line with the photos, an accordion-style image slideshow, and
                slideshows broken out by interior, exterior, OEM photos, shown one at a&nbsp;time.

                Kicking off with sketching ideas, we designed and tested layout variations, mixing in data
                visualization, and looking at some ways to make the calculator&nbsp;touch-friendly.

            <h3 class="compact">Tabs: Iterating on UI Style</h3>
            <p>
                Redesigning the VDP presented an opportunity to explore UI styles to use for tabs
                across&nbsp;Cars.com
            </p>
            <h3 class="compact">Top Shop Badge</h3>
            <p>
                “Top Shop” was a concept for dealership distinction that could be earned through customer
                reviews. We explored icons for this to display next to dealership&nbsp;information.
            </p>
            <h3 class="compact">“More Map” by Dealer Information</h3>
            <p>
                At the same time, we explored ways to visually show more of a map visual around the
                information cluster of dealer&nbsp;information.

    <h2>m.Cars.com</h2>
    <p>
        At the time of this project, users on mobile devices were directed to a separate, m-dot version of
        the site. The content of the wired VDP had to be stripped down to focus on the most essential
        content and be easy to scan on-the-go. Its branding had to reflect that of the wired site, but be
        touch-friendly. Influenced by the explosion of smartphone use, we made the move to go
        responsive in 2015 and we transitioned to re-thinking all content to be “mobile-first.”
    </p>

    <!-- wide image goes here -->

    <h2>Results for the Business</h2>
    <p>
        In the new VDP delivered a cleaner and more engaging design with a larger photo experience,
        better vehicle differentiation, and easier to consume sections of content, like Seller’s Notes and
        Car Features. The lead conversion rate improved by 62%, resulting in $36M yearly run-rate of
        increased value to customers. We synced up with another team during the redesign to support
        vehicle saving/favoriting from the VDP for Consumer Profiles. The new design worked in a new
        ad unit for national advertisers and new logo sizes for advertisers subscribed to a tier of their
        affiliation with us. Dealers and national advertisers got a faster platform to merchandise their
        vehicles and feature ads.
